## What is Memebership history?

This is an Civicrm extension to display membership renewal history.

Currently, when a membership is renewed in CiviCRM the “end date” field on the membership itself is extended by the length of the membership as defined in CiviCRM membership type configuration but no record of the actual length of any one period or term is recorded. As such it is not possible to see how many “terms” or “periods” of membership a contact may have had. 

I.e. If a membership commenced on 1 Jan 2014 and each term was of 12 months in length, by 1 Jan 2016 the member would be renewing for their 3rd term. The terms would be:

Term/Period 1: 1 Jan 2014 - 31 Dec 2015
Term/Period 2: 1 Jan 2015 - 31 Dec 2016
Term/Period 3: 1 Jan 2016 - 31 Dec 2017

The aim of this extension is to extend the CiviCRM membership component so that when a membership is created or renewed a record for the membership “period” is recorded. 

The membership period is also connected to a contribution record if a payment is taken for this membership or renewal.
